# Better Moon Pillars
> Pillar reworks from RM and WRB, as a standalone mod

* Configurable amount for moon pillars.
* Moon pillars can reward items (potential-able, configurable)
* Moon pillars can rewind time for scaling (meant to be used with [Downpour](https://thunderstore.io/package/prodzpod/Downpour/), configurable)
* Minimum radius for moon pillars. (for Focused Convergence)

By default, moon elevators will be unlocked from the start. Completing a pillar will reward you with a choice between 2 greens and a lunar.
